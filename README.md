# AI Data Insight Dashboard (v0.1)

An interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for quick data exploration, automated insights, and machine learning evaluation.  
Upload your dataset (CSV or Excel), run exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate a natural language report with a local LLM, and benchmark basic ML models.

---

## âœ¨ Features (v0.1)
- **Upload CSV/Excel** and preview your dataset
- **EDA tab**: summary stats, missing values, correlations, distributions
- **ML Insights tab**: automatic classification/regression detection, performance tables, and metric explanations
- **LLM Report tab**: client-style data report generated by [Mistral](https://ollama.com/library/mistral) via Ollama
- **Export**: download the generated report in Markdown format

---

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

Tested on Python 3.13. If you encounter dependency issues on newer versions, use 3.11.
The **LLM Report** tab requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed locally with the **Mistral** model pulled.
Without Ollama + Mistral, the dashboard still runs, but the LLM Report tab will not function.


### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ai-data-dashboard.git
cd ai-data-dashboard
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Activate it
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up Ollama (for local LLM)

- Install Ollama (if not already installed)
- Pull the Mistral model:

```bash
ollama pull mistral
```

### 5. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Example Datasets

Two small sample datasets are included for quick testing:

- **titanic.csv** â€“ trimmed to 50 rows; can be used to test a **classification** workflow (predicting survival).  
- **insurance.csv** â€“ trimmed to 50 rows; can be used to test a **regression** workflow (predicting charges).  

You can also upload your own CSV/XLSX datasets.

## Notes on Preprocessing

- **High-cardinality text columns**: During preprocessing, text columns with many unique values (IDs, tickets, free-text, etc.) may be dropped to keep models tractable. This is expected; it avoids exploding the feature space.
- **Missing values**: For model training, numeric columns have missing values imputed with the column mean, and categorical columns are imputed with the most frequent category. The original data preview (EDA tab) still shows missing values before preprocessing.
